"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising  was born  
No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do 
 to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely ful. Nor again is there anyone
  who loves or pursues or desires to obtain  of itself, because it is , but because occasionally 
   procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakesphysical 
   xcept to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right t
   o find fault with a man who 
   chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one 
   who avoids a  that pro
   duces no resultant pleasure?"
